title: Software project checklist
---

An active commercial project should have the following:

- A project README, with what/how/why/who and a project vision. It should additionally contain instructions for getting set up with the project and links to external resources, eg product documentation, the issue tracker, CI.
- CI capable of building the software, running tests, and creating releases.
- A straightforward way for a new developer to start, ideally automated and regularly tested (eg docker containers). It is even better if existing developers can use the same tooling to stay up to date with requirements for the project.
- A single step build + deploy + debug cycle.
- An enforced code style.
- Automated tests.
- Some way to collect feedback from the software (metrics, stack traces, ...), where possible.
