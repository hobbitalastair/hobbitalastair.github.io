[ASN.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1) is a textual declarative language
for describing data structures. The primary use case is supporting writing
encoders and decoders for different wire formats.

Protobuf is a similar project, but that protobuf is both the language and the
wire format. ASN.1 has several different wire formats, the most useful of which
are probably:

- OER (binary, simple)
- Unaligned PER (binary, most compact)
- DER (binary, self describing, canonical)
- JER (JSON, self describing)

## Language

Some of the supported data types:

- Booleans
- Integers (unbounded in size or optionally bounded)
- Floats ("real")
- Structs ("sequence", fixed size lists of different types)
- Arrays ("sequence of", lists of a single type, can be bounded in size)
- Enums ("enumerated")
- Tagged union ("choice")
- Strings ("UTF8String", but also other variants)
- Timestamps and durations (various options here)

[Quick reference covering the types](https://www.oss.com/asn1/resources/asn1-made-simple/asn1-quick-reference.html).

It is possible to add bounds to the size of elements. With bounds, ASN.1 is
suitable for describing messages for embedded systems.

With care, it is possible to extend a protocol file. Tags (field numberings)
are typically based on the order that fields appear in. The type of a field
should never be changed, otherwise it may change how it is encoded.

## Ecosystem

Despite ASN.1 being from the 80s, the ecosystem is quite minimal. At the time
of writing, several client libraries exist but they typically only support DER.
There is a encoder/decoder generator for embedded systems from the ESA, but it
is written in F#. Wireshark has a degree of builtin support, but it requires
building a custom plugin.

[Python has decent looking third party support](https://pypi.org/project/asn1tools/).
[Rust has a no\_std library](https://github.com/librasn/rasn).

The entire Interface Definition Language (IDL) space is very crowded, with
plenty of different solutions. Other options may be better here.
